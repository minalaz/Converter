# Converter
Assignment16 for homework on IT bootcamp course/Task2:

-  Make a class Converter that has attributes rsd and currency. Currency is an enum, while rsd is an integer. Currency should be one of:
EUR, USD, AUD, CAD, RUB and GBP. Values for dinars (rsd) and currency are entered through the constructor, and there are setters, but there are no getters. Make a method that is used to convert the currency to the one that is passed through the constructor or setter. That is, rsd converts to that currency. In the method use if/else or switch for comparison. See how enums are compared in Java most correctly. In main - test by making one object of type Converter and try for all currencies.
